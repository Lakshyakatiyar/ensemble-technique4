    "1.A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average of the predictions of the individual trees to make the final prediction. This method leverages the strengths of decision trees while mitigating their weaknesses, particularly overfitting"
